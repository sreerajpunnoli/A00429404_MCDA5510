MCDA5510 Course Repository

I am Sreeraj Punnoli(A00429404). My preffered email id is "sreeraj.punnoli@smu.ca". For the past 2 years I have been working as a software engineer. I did my bachelors in Electronics and Communication Engineering from TKM College of Engineering in Kerala, India.

It would be better if we cover basics of .Net and Microsoft Asure in the class.

I have worked on JAVA, Python, MySQL, OracleDB, Hadoop, etc.

I hope with this course I would be able to gain confidence to work in both front end and back end of the application.
